Hi, I'm Conrad, a software engineer based in Manila, Philippines. I'm currently a DevOps engineer at [Cascadeo](https://www.cascadeo.com/).

Outside of software engineering, I like reading about history, politics, psychology, micromobility, and conspiracy theories. Sometimes I like to imagine fictional places and create them in games such as Minecraft and Cities: Skylines.

I love listening to music - here's my [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/conradolega). Some genres I like include new jack swing, quiet storm, power ballads, prog, jazz, and city pop. Here's a short playlist of songs I liked last year:
