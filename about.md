Hi, I'm Conrad, a software engineer based in Manila, Philippines. I focus on the cloud and DevOps side of things, looking at some data engineering on the side. [Currently looking for work!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conradolega/)

Outside of my job, I like reading about history, politics, psychology, micromobility, and genealogy. Sometimes I like to imagine fictional places and create them in games such as Minecraft and Cities: Skylines. Recently, I've poured lots of effort and passion into researching my family history using sites such as [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/).

I am a proud bike commuter, despite the chaos and inherent danger in the streets of this car-centric society. Choosing this path has helped me grow immensely as a person–getting around faster, in a way that's healthier for myself and less polluting, and being part of an amazing community.

I love listening to music. Some genres I like include new jack swing, quiet storm, power ballads, prog, jazz, and city pop, and I'm currently exploring the wonderful world of salsa.

If you'd like to know more, you can [email me](mailto:conradolega@gmail.com)!
