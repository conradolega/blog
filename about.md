Hi, I'm Conrad, a software engineer based in Manila, Philippines. I'm currently a team lead at [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/). I'm also interested in DevOps and SRE and might consider being one in the future.

Outside of software engineering, I like reading about history, politics, psychology, and conspiracy theories. Sometimes I draw maps of fictional places.

I love listening to music. Especially 90s R&B. Here's one of my favorites!
