The first time I heard harmonics on the bass guitar was the opening seconds of this magical song by Dream Theater, _Lifting Shadows Off A Dream_. Listen to it here:

I didn't know that such sounds were possible on an instrument one would usually associate with grooving and slapping. To play such notes, you wouldn't fully press down your finger on the neck - just enough to suppress the overtones. I didn't have a six string bass to play the high E, so I just focused on playing other, more "normal" basslines, albeit rather poorly.

That is, until I came upon _Portrait of Tracy_, by the legend himself, Jaco Pastorius. This was sampled in songs like _Rain_ by SWV and _Pullin' Me Back_ by Chingy.

A freeform composition without any accompaniment, this song feels like a dream, due not only in part to all the harmonics being played. And Jaco only needed four strings for it! So one night I decided to try my hand at it.

Until this song I only thought that harmonics could be played on specific places on the string, like the fifth fret. Jaco found harmonics everywhere, and was not constrained to using open strings, as I discovered when I looked for tabs (it would've been impossible for me to figure it out otherwise). For example, at some point he presses down on the second fret of the A string, and touches the sixth fret slightly, creating a Eb harmonic. This note is a bitch to play, especially for someone like me with small hands!

The last chord is also difficult - first you fret the ninth fret of the D and G strings, then play the harmonic on the 13th. The hard part is to get the harmonic to ring loud and clear.

I haven't fully played the song yet, just some of the easier parts - already enough to put me in a different kind of mood. While already challenging enough from a technical standpoint, what really makes this song is the feeling that Jaco puts into it. That's something I will never replicate, and something I have to create for my own.

Now excuse me. I need to practice...
