Nearly _eight years_ since I last made a post here. I haven't exactly stopped writing, but the words can be found elsewhere—in my notebooks, Facebook, Instagram, even Strava. 

Needless to say that so much has changed in my life ([and everyone else's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)). Maybe I'll go through some of those changes in later posts. It's not that hard to get engagement on social media platforms, but sometimes you crave for a little corner of the Internet that is truly your own, allowing for better self-expression outside of those walled gardens.

But another reason I am reviving this site is, as I get back into the DevOps groove after a short hiatus, I am going to use this to practice my CI/CD skills. Fixing the build for this site should be a good starting point.

Never too late to begin again!
