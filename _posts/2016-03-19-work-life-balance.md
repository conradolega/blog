It took me a long time before I got to write this post. In the back of my mind, I have a list of things to write about, but finding time can be hard. (Motivation is different, but a lack of motivation can come from fatigue caused by spending too much time on other things.)

I've adjusted to a schedule that doesn't revolve around the usual 9-5. Instead, I go to work much earlier. Traffic is terrible here, and mass transit isn't always guaranteed to work. Going out earlier leaves me allowance for such uncertainties.

Here's my typical schedule for a weekday:

| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| 3:30 AM | Wake up |
| 5:00 AM | Head to work |
| 6:30 AM | Arrive at the office |
| 3:30 PM | Leave the office |
| 5:00 PM | Arrive at home |
| 9:30 PM | Go to sleep |

(I try to sleep as much as possible if I get a seat during my commute.)

Four and a half hours of free time goes by pretty fast. Usually, doing those hours, I eat dinner, log my daily expenses, and do a little workout if I can. I read a lot, though not really books - more of Internet posts and social media. As you can see, there aren't really any creative tasks here. Well, my brain is already tired at this point, way ahead of my body.

Unfortunately, this schedule is pretty rigid, and a deviation on, say, Wednesday would throw the rest of the week off. I can only go out on Friday (and Saturday), pretty much, because I don't have to worry about waking up late the next day. I really wonder how other people manage to fit many more things - games, gigs, watching series, housekeeping, studying, writing, and others - into their day-to-day schedule.

There's some things I have in mind to free up my time.

- **Minimizing the commute** - right now, that's three hours wasted everyday. Maybe I could move closer to work. I also had to do remote work one day, and I felt that I was more productive. Maybe it was because I didn't have to go to any meetings!

- **Don't check email after leaving the office** - I can do this the following day. After all, I'm already on the road before the sun is up. But this requires everyone to get used to asynchronous communication, something that's going obsolete in today's age of instant chat and all emails being urgent. (I read a [post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.wmfkwmyqx) about this today.) Speaking of chat...

- **Spend less time on social media, or the Internet in general** - I'm a masochist online; I read comments on politics posts on Facebook, and posts on places like [/r/bestofoutrageculture](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofoutrageculture). Maybe skipping that can make me happier in addition to freeing up some time.

What do I replace those with? Reading novels. Or learning devops or Rails. Or getting back to playing an instrument. I could do some sideline, maybe keep writing here. Even more sleep would do wonders.

Writing this took me an hour. I hope it's not time wasted.
