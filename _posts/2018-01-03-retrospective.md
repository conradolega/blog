Software engineers working in an Agile environment are familiar with the regular _retrospective_. Usually compiled by an Agile team at the end of a sprint, these generally follow the following outline:

- _What went well?_
- _What went wrong?_
- _What can we do to improve?_

Like how tasks are broken down in Agile, the answer to the last question is ideally a list of well-defined action items. For example, if a bug was caused by code that did not have tests, a good action item would be to increase the test coverage to, say, 80% in that area. Other times, it may be as simple as reading a book about a certain topic, to prepare for a future implementation.

At some point, I realized I could apply it not only to work, but to looking back at my life in general. So, I began to write a retrospective for the year 2016 - but never got to finish it. (_What went wrong?_)

This year, I plan to complete the retrospective for 2017. And to make it easier to backtrack when 2019 comes, I've made a list of my goals for 2018. I've tried to flesh out these requirements, much like a good product manager will not just assign tasks on a whim.

Doing a retrospective on something you should know very well - yourself - is also a good writing exercise. You don't need to be a good writer - just note everything that comes to mind, whether it be about travelling the world or cleaning your room.

And yes, one of my 2018 goals is to write more blog posts. ðŸ˜ƒ Have fun writing!
